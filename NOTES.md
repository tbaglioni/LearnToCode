## Learning strategies 
* 1st Sweetspot between Active and Passive learning 2h/1h ratio at the start, later 1h/1h
* 2st Apply Spacing - spread learning in more daily short stages
* 3rd Teaching/Reexplaining Concepts - teach, write blog, FB group post etc.
* 4th Keep Track of all the things you have questions about - Textpad or google doc
* 5th Rest and Recover - you need sleep that brain can recover and memorize, lack of sleep = lower IQ
* I wanna do 20 min a day 5 days a week, remeber to incorporate spaces and rest
* What you learn can never be taking away!
