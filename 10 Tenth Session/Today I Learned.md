* I read about JavaScript Syntax and it defines two types of values Fixed Values and Variable Values. 
* Fixed are called literals and Variable values are called variables.
* Code after double slashes // is treated as comment and is leaved out.
* In JavaScript first character must be a Letter or an underscore _ or a Dollar sign $.
* JavaScript is Case Sensitive.
* I will use Upper Camel Case (PascalCase).
* JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.
* Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.
* JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.
* JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.
* The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.
* Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.
* Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.
* It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
