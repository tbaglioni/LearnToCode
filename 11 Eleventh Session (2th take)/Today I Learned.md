* I went out to walk with Brian and we did a almost 10 km of good walking we talked about life and how we could use it to make things better. Give 1% every day in a 3 month period. Try to write down what u feel and what u think. I have to make 5 min of programming evey day.
* 1 cigarette 2 cigarette I have lots of ideas and cant seem to find out what I really want it should give me but thinks that if I keep writing I must come up with something and that something is this text.
* I must focus on the better things in life instead of always have problems on my mind.
* Im learning about JavaScript Variables, Operators, Arithmetic
* Have done the Variables exercise and I did complete it.
* Now I go to JavaScript Data Types and will read about that and make the exercise afterward.
* Today I took the JS Data Types tutorial and this is something important to remember.
* JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more.
* Numbers can be written with, or without decimals.
* Booleans can only have two values: true or false.
* JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.
* JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.
* In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined.
* An empty value has nothing to do with undefined.
* An empty string has both a legal value and a type.
* In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.
* Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.
* The typeof operator can return one of two complex types: function and object.
* The typeof operator returns "object" for objects, arrays, and null.
* The typeof operator does not return "object" for functions.
